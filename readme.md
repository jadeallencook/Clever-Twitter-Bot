## Getting Started

In order to get started, you'll need to get an API key from the CleverBot website. 

[https://www.cleverbot.com/api/](https://www.cleverbot.com/api/)

Once you have an API key, you'll need to add it to the inject script.

```ssh
/src/inject/inject.js
```

You'll then be able to open up Chrome Extensions, switch on developer mode, and "load unpacked extension"!
